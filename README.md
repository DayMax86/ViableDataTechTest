Here is my implementation of the back-end tech task. The commit on the afternoon of the 19th was rushed as the original email I received describing the tech task stated "the deadline for submission is on the 21st of June 2024 Friday before 5.30PM. This should give you 4 days to complete the task".

Please clone the repo and run the unit tests to test the functionality of the code. Any questions please get in touch!
