Here is my implementation of the back-end tech task. The commit on the afternoon of the 19th was rushed as the original email I received describing the tech task stated "the deadline for submission is on the 21st of June 2024 Friday before 5.30PM. This should give you 4 days to complete the task". As such I have returned to the task this morning to make some changes to improve functionality and fix any errors I can find.

Please clone the repo and...

1. run Main.java. While it is running go to http://localhost:4567/books in your browser to view what the service returns. Comment/uncomment the various get() methods in main and refresh your browser page to see the updated results.
  
2. run the unit tests to test the functionality of the code.
  
Any questions please get in touch!
